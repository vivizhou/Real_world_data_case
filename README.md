# Real_world_data_case
This project contains the solutions for a real world problem regarding dosing strategy for medications in children with organ transplant.

Data have been extracted from EHR regarding the use of tacrolimus in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. One of the known side effects of tacrolimus is the decline of renal function over time.


Problem 1

We have a data set of 500 patients. However, all the data are stored in the old excel file type (.xls). Please write a program to convert these files into (.xlsx) in a batch and execute it as well.

Problem 2

Data have been extracted from EHR regarding the use of tacrolimus in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. One of the known side effects of tacrolimus is the decline of renal function over time.

To have a better understanding of this problem, we would like you to show us how many patients develop chronic kidney disease.
Design and conduct an analysis of the data to determine possible factors contributing to this decline in renal function over time.
Is there a dose-response relationship between tacrolimus and renal function? Please design and conduct the analysis.
